    destination: 'Japan Discovery',
    text: 'Our Japan Discovery tour was incredible! The attention to detail in the itinerary allowed us to experience both modern and traditional aspects of Japanese culture. The ryokan stay was a highlight, and our guide\'s knowledge of local history made each site visit meaningful. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that some days felt a bit rushed, but overall an amazing experience!'
